# Promises

A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to attach callbacks for handling the success or failure of that operation.

## Callback functions

A function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed.

## Higher Order functions

A function that takes one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function as its result.
