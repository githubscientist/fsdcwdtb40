# Modules and Imports in JavaScript

There are two primary module systems in JavaScript:

1.  CommonJS (CJS)
    - The CommonJS module system is primarily used in Node.js.
    - The extension for CommonJS files is typically `.js` and we can also use `.cjs`.
2.  ECMAScript Modules (ESM)
    - The ECMAScript module system is the standardized module system for JavaScript.
    - The extension for ECMAScript module files is typically `.mjs` and we can also use `.js` if specified in the `package.json`.
