## CSS Positioning

1. Static Positioning: This is the default positioning for HTML elements. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

2. Fixed Positioning: Elements with fixed positioning are positioned relative to the viewport, which means they stay in the same place even when the page is scrolled.

3. Sticky Positioning: Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. An element with sticky positioning toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.
