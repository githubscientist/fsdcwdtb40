## CSS Positioning

1. Static Positioning: This is the default positioning for HTML elements. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

2. Fixed Positioning: Elements with fixed positioning are positioned relative to the viewport, which means they stay in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
