# synchronous vs asynchronous

- synchronous: blocking
  - a function that waits for another function to complete before executing the next line of code.
- asynchronous: non-blocking
  - a function that can execute without waiting for another function to complete, allowing other code to run in the meantime.

# async and await

- `async` keyword: used to declare a function as asynchronous. It allows the use of `await` within the function.
- `await` keyword: used to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise is resolved or rejected.
