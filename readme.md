# Flex Box in CSS

- Flexbox or the Flexible Box Layout is a CSS3 web layout model.
- It is designed to provide a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.
- Flexbox allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon screen size (or device).
- Flexbox is particularly useful for designing layouts for single-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
