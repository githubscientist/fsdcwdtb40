# JavaScript

- It's a dynamically typed language used for web development.
- Because during runtime, types are determined on the fly.

# TypeScript

- It's a Superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- Because it allows developers to define types, enabling type checking at compile time.
- TypeScript developed by Microsoft.
- It helps catch errors early in the development process and improves code maintainability.
- JavaScript code does not by default have type annotations, hence, we will not be able to catch type-related errors until runtime.
- The browsers can only understand JavaScript, so TypeScript code needs to be transpiled (converted) into JavaScript before it can be executed in a browser or a JavaScript runtime environment like Node.js.
- TypeScript files have a `.ts` extension, while JavaScript files have a `.js` extension.
