# Block Level Elements

- The elements that start on a new line and take up the full width available are called block-level elements.

- Examples:
  - `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, etc.

# Inline Elements

- The elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary are called inline elements.

- Examples:
  - `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<img>`, etc.
