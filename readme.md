# synchronous vs asynchronous

- synchronous: blocking
  - a function that waits for another function to complete before executing the next line of code.
- asynchronous: non-blocking
  - a function that can execute without waiting for another function to complete, allowing other code to run in the meantime.

# async and await

- `async` keyword: used to declare a function as asynchronous. It allows the use of `await` within the function.
- `await` keyword: used to pause the execution of an async function until a Promise is resolved or rejected.

# XHR: XMLHttpRequest

- It is used to make HTTP requests to fetch data from a server without refreshing the page.

# Fetch API

- It is a modern interface that allows you to make HTTP requests similar to XHR but with a more powerful and flexible feature set.
- It has come replacing XHR in many applications due to its simplicity and ease of use.

# AXIOS

- It is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from the browser and Node.js.
- It is built on top of the Fetch API and provides additional features.

# Event Handling

- Events: Any user interaction or occurrence in the system (like clicks, key presses, etc.)
- Event Listeners: Functions that wait for specific events to occur and execute code in response.
