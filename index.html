        <p class="italics green">Blogging is storytelling. And a good blog design becomes a part of the stories you tell.</p>

        <p>The keys to a great blog design remain the same across categories:</p>

        <ul id="list">
            <li><strong>Comfortable to Read</strong> — Blogs should have a comfortable reading experience. Go with a clear (yet on-brand) font, an
            easy-to-read font size (16px-20px), and contain paragraphs to a conventional width (600px-800px).</li>

                    finance blog can
                    communicate seriousness and clarity. A whimsical, cartoonish parenting blog can suggest fun and relatability.</li>

            <li><strong>Keep It Simple</strong> — Keep your blog design conventional so that readers have an intuition about how to navigate. Don’t
            design something so unusual that it confuses readers! Use a typical blog structure (featured posts or recent posts at
            the top) and add a search bar, tags, and categories to make discovering blog posts easy.</li>
        </ul>
